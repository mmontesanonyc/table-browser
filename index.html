  <h1>Survey Catalog</h1>
  <p>This tool allows you to search for full wording of DOHMH survey questions by Topic and Subtopic, or by word (or by word within Topic and Subtopic). The questionnaire bank includes the most recent wording of questions from our many health surveillance surveys, including the Community Health Survey, NYC KIDS, the high school and middle school Youth Risk Behavior Surveys, as well as recent surveys conducted using the Health NYC Panel, and others. If you are seeking a question not contained in the catalog please email us at <a href="mailto:surveybank@health.nyc.gov">surveybank@health.nyc.gov</a></p>

// loading csv using d3. This is one way to get a CSV into your page's code so that you can manipulate it using JavaScript. It's a lot easier to manipulate a JS variable than to retrieve and manipulate HTML elements.
var data
d3.csv('data.csv').then(csv => {
  data = csv;
  console.log("Here is our data array:")
  console.log(data)
})

// here's an example of how we can filter the object. You could set up your page with event listeners on search or a dropdown filters, and the event listener runs the function filter('search term').

// this example function just searches the 'Question Text' field of the dadta.
function filter(x) {
  var results = []; // create an empty array for results
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    if (data[i]['Question Text'].includes(x)) {
      results.push(data[i]) // if the field includes the searched-text, push the question to a results array.
    } else {};
  };
  console.table(results) // /show the results in the console.

  html = arqueroTable.toHTML(); // print arqueroTable to an HTML table
  console.log(html)
